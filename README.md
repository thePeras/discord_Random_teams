# TEAM RANDOM GENERATOR

This project is a discord bot that split the members of a voice channel.
The members are splited in two teams, random generated.

# History

The project come to a head when me and my frinds wanted to play some games but actually we were more than a team required. 
So we usually slipt us in half.
We used a web tool to do it, but it required to much time.
Because time is money, this bot doesn't give you money but less work.

## things to implement

- [x] Generate costum players roles example: Lucker, Snipper, etc....
- [x] Ask for reaction for move teams players for a channel
- [ ] Slow generationg with roullete animation
